# MriSoc-Queen-Edition
A modified version of the [mrisoc](https://github.com/mriscoc/Ender3V2S1.git) Ender 3 v2 / S1 binary for the Ender 3 v2 neo.
- Supports BlTouch/CrTouch on ender 3 v2 neo.
- Supports Marlin Unified Bed Leveling.
- Supports Model Predictive Temperature Control
- Supports Auto PID tuning.
- Currently binary was built for Creality 4.2.2 only, and DACAI model display boards.
- Added the folowing g-code commands previously unavailable:
  - C10 : Mark the g-code file as a Configuration file to avoid confirm to print and print done dialogs (at least one space is currently required after the C10).
  - C11 En Rn Gn Bn : colorize UI elements (C11 E0 to update the screen)
  - C29 Ln Rn Fn Bn Tn Nn Xn Ym : set probing mesh inset (Left, Right, Front, Back) in mm.  T is the probing temperature (T0 doesn't change the current bed temperature) and N is the density or amount of grid points NxN, it is posible to set a NxM density by using X and Y. In UBL use G29 S# to save to a mesh slot number #.
  - C35 Launch the bed tramming wizard.
  - C100 Xn Yn Zn : setup minimum physical limits
  - C101 Xn Yn Zn : setup maximum physical limits
  - C102 Xn Yn : setup bed size (can't be larger than physical limits)
  - C104 U1 Tn : unlock the maximum hotend temperature temperature to ###°C (limited by thermistor calibration table CAUTION, the stock hot-end doesn't support more than 260°C due to the isolators and PTFE degradation.)
  - C108 : cancel screens waiting for user simple confirmation
  - C125 Xn Yn Zn : setup the park position
  - C250 Pn : enable or disable preview screen (needs PREVIEW_MENU_ITEM)
  - C412 Mn : set run-out sensor active state (M0:LOW, M1:HIGH, M2:MOTION)
  - C510 Un : lock/unlock the screen (C510 U1 to unlock)
  - C562 En : invert the Extruder (E1 to invert)
  - C810 An Bn Cn Dn En : sets up the toolbar shortcuts A..E to functions 0..n (0 disable that shortcut)
  - C851 Sn [Zn] Mn : Set probe Z feed speed (S) in mm/min, Multiple probing (Mn>1) or disables it (M0), in manual mesh version, Z parameter can be used to set a manual Z-offset. 
- **Warning:** The temperature limits and Speed controls have been removed and replaced by user specified limits under the advanced menu. If the printer is asked to go to a certain temparature within the user set range it will, regardless of possibility of damage so be careful.
